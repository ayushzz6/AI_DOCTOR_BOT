I have been using this problem from the last many days.,"With what I see, I think you have acne, which appears to be moderate in severity, with multiple red bumps and pimples on your cheek. I would suggest a combination of topical creams or gels containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to help reduce inflammation and prevent further breakouts, as well as good skincare habits such as keeping your face clean and moisturized.",,2025-07-04 21:35:56.598712
